/**
 * The class Road that can represent the edges of a Graph of Towns
 * The class must implement Comparable 
 * The class stores references to the two vertices(Town endpoints), 
 * the distance between vertices, and a name, and the traditional methods 
 * (constructors, getters/setters, toString, etc.), and a compareTo, which 
 * compares two Road objects 
 * Since this is a undirected graph, an edge from A to B is equal to 
 * an edge from B to A.
